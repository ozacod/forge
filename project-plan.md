## Project Plan

The aim of this project to create a webpage that will let me choose c++ libraries to add my project and options will be choosable like from libhunt website. For example when I write json it will let me choose json11 or nlohmann json. After I choose the libraries it will create the cmake file and the project structure. And let me download zip file for it. I will add new details.

I want you to write project with fastapi backend and react frontend with tailwindcss. % 

## Recipes

recipe files for github projects and will be let edit. It will contain like options build with test use this option etc and then will let me add this dependency there will be like set of libraries that will be added to project with options frontend will let you choose those options. It will add features like statically build dynamically build linking openssl etc. Recipes should not be hardcoded in python file there must be separate file and should be loaded by backend.
